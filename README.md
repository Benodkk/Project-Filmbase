On the user's dedicated page, all the movies and TV shows that the user has liked, rated or added to their "to watch" list will be displayed.

### User profile

The user page showcases a curated selection of movies and series that have been favored, rated, or added to the "to watch" list by the user. In cases where the lists contain more than six items and not all of them can be displayed on the page, a convenient button will appear, allowing the user to navigate to a dedicated page that displays all the items in the list
